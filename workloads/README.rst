Workload File
=============

The YAML files in this directory are *Workload Files* that describe a set of
operations that the MongoDB driver under test will run while connected to the
MongoDB cluster in Kubernetes. The documents must be complete tests as defined
by the `Unified Test Format specification
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/unified-test-format/unified-test-format.rst>`_.
