# Upgrade the MongoDB server version from 5.0.8 to 5.0.12. That will cause a rolling deploy where
# each pod is terminated and recreated with the new server version. This process typically takes
# between 5 and 10 minutes for a 3-node replica set.
# This test case is used to assert that reads and writes can continue when a rolling deploy of the
# MongoDB replica set happens.

  # server version 5.0.8, which is defined in "kubernetes/kind/mongodb.yml". If the server version in
  # that config file changes, this upgrade version must be updated as well.
